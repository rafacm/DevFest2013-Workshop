   * Exercise 5

   * You have probably have already noticed that there is a

   *                  between a and b

   *  - sumSquares(a, b): calculates the sum of the squares
   *                      of all integers between a and b
   *
   * The pattern is that we are calculating the sum of a
   * function applied to all integers between two given
   * numbers!
   *
   *  - sumRec(a, b): the function is the identity function
   *                 f(n) = n

   *  - sumSquares(a, b): the function is the square function
   *                      f(n) = n * n
   *
   * could we generalize this?
   *
   * Yes! This is where the power of higher-order functions comes in!
   * Let's create a "sum" function that takes another function as an
   * argument and calculates the sum of applying that function to all
   * integers between two given numbers.

   * Note at how the f parameter is defined with the "=>" symbol to
   * indicate the f is a function that takes one Int argument and

   * objects that can be passed around like any other value.

   * For instance, we can create a function that computes the 2 to
